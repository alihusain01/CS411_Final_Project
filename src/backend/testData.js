Your mission is to successfully exterminate your enemys civilian population whilst saving your own. Points are awarded or lost depending on both the efficacy and thoroughness of your nuclear vendetta and the number of your own civilian deaths.  In order to win you must wipe out the enemy population and simultaneously disable the enemys ability to retaliate against you. This is an extremely difficult task since launching an attack on the enemy exposes the positions of your own Ground Silos Subs and Bombers the moment they launch nuclear weapons making you extremely vulnerable and exposed to a crushing counter-attack. Desperate attempts must be made to form fast tactical alliances alliances that may at any moment break-down to become the treacherous and most deadly of betrayals. Everyone looks to each other in a state of nervous suspense and paranoid accusation. In all-out nuclear Armageddon everybody dies everybody loses you just have to make sure you lose the least!",

The Empire is decaying from within as self-proclaimed rulers struggle for control of the now vacant throne while a cruel Inquisition sweeps across the human lands causing rebellion and misery. Meanwhile the Clans recovering from their near-destruction begin to reunite their tribes. They have received divine instructions and now seek to uncover an ancient ritual that will let them communicate with their god Wotan. Disciples II: Servants of the Dark is a stand-alone expansion that brings you into the never-ending quest for supremacy as either the Undead Hordes or the Legions of the Damned. On the dark side the Legions of the Damned enact a plan to spread Bethrezens plague across Nevendaar. They sense the threat brought about by the rebirth of the Elven god and will stop at nothing to steal this power for their own purposes. Perhaps most pivotal to the conflict however is Mortis and her army of Undead Hordes. After all the rebirth of her husband Gallean was her doing. He had rejected her for what she had become a twisted heartless beast. Now she would teach her mate a lesson... one that would scar his people for eternity...

While the game draws on identifiable sources such as Quake The Sims and Clue it mashes these elements together with a few new ideas to create an innovative experience that doesnt play like any of its inspirations.8.3 - Gamespotthe game twists around the Clue formula to make it a little more interesting. Instead of having to uncover a killer The Ship makes you the killer. The main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target called your quarry and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so there are plenty of lethal odds-and-ends to wield and even some environmental traps. Its certainly a quirky take on first-person gaming but its an entertaining one once you get the hang of it.7.4 - IGN",
